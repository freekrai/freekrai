### Hi there 👋


Hi. I’m Roger. I'm a fullstack software engineer, devops engineer, author and dad from Canada.

🔭 I’m currently working on multiple frontend and backend projects using React, Remix, Nextjs, Vue, Nodejs and Hasura

🌱 I’m currently learning to never stop learning.

I build a lot of things using many stacks, currently mostly working with React / Remix / Nextjs and Nodejs with GraphQL APIs which is a fun stack fun to work with.
