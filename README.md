I build a lot of things using many stacks, currently mostly working with Astro / React / Remix / Nextjs and Nodejs with various APIs.  

* üåç¬† I'm based in Penticton, British Columbia, Canada

I'm also a big camping and hiking enthusiast. When I'm not hanging out with my family or at the computer, or at a coffee shop, you can find me camping or hiking somewhere in the mountains around the Okanagan valley where I live.
