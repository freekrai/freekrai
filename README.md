Hi ![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18350557/176309783-0785949b-9127-417c-8b55-ab5a4333674e.gif)My name is Roger 

I'm a Product Engineer, AI Automation Engineer, author and dad from Canada, with over 2 decades in the field.

🔭 I’m currently working on multiple frontend and backend projects using Astro, React, Remix, Nextjs, Nodejs, and various AI integrations. 

I build a lot of things using many stacks, currently mostly working with Astro / React / Remix / Nextjs and Nodejs with various APIs.  

* 🌍  I'm based in Penticton, British Columbia, Canada 
* 🖥️  Read my blog at [Roger Stringer](https://rogerstringer.com)
* 🧠  I'm learning to never stop learning. 
* 🤝  I'm open to collaborating on interesting projects

I'm also a big camping and hiking enthusiast. When I'm not hanging out with my family or at the computer, or at a coffee shop, you can find me camping or hiking somewhere in the mountains around the Okanagan valley where I live.
