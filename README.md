### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi. Iâ€™m Roger. I'm a full stack developer, devops engineer, author and dad.

I build a lot of things using many stacks, currently mostly working with React / Nextjs and nodejs with GraphQL APIs which is fun to work with.

For more information about me, check out [rogerstringer.com](https://rogerstringer.com/) or [Coded Geekery](https://codedgeekery.com/).
